### WDI Jeopardy by Morgan Murrah - v2.0

This game started as one of my first ever web projects and was my first application of HTML, CSS, Javsacript and JQuery.

This game has been simplified/ a lot of refactoring of my horrible earlier code. The game now makes use of the new CSS Grid specification [which is not fully supported yet](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid). 

### Current Game:

#### Future develoment:

* Make the game competitive/two player
* Add a high-score table, or way of saving/sharing a score result

#### Technologies used in this game include:

 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * Bootstrap 3.3.7
 * JQuery
